## :question: Why Summer UI?

<i> " I want to **develop** a **modern**, **consistent** and **accessible** user interfaces such Facebook UI, but **I don't know nothing** about the design fundamentals and principles! How can I grasp knowledge about designing user interfaces without **reading dozens of blogs, books** and spending a **long time**? How can I give a constructive feedback to our designer about a part of the UI?" </i> These are the frequent questions I ask myself while I write the front-end code using HTML, CSS, JS or a popular framework such React, Vue or Sevelte. If you're a **FRONT-END** developer, you may encountered these situations where you **struggle** to create a beautiful and universal user interfaces though your killer skills in programming. My mission though this project is to simplify the design for **FRONT-END** developers.
