## :question: Why Summer UI?

<i> " I want to **develop** **modern**, **consistent** and **accessible** user interfaces such as Facebook UI, but **I don't know nothing** about the **design fundamentals and principles!** or the best workflow that let me code **static mockups and prototypes** and convert them to dynamic UI in the browser with an **effective** way. How can I grasp knowledge about designing user interfaces without spending **long time in reading dozens of blogs and books**? How can I give a constructive feedback to our designer(s) about the current UI?" </i>

These are the frequent questions I ask myself when I develop the user interfaces using HTML, CSS, JS or a popular framework such React, Vue or Sevelte. If you're a **FRONT-END** developer, you may encountered these situations where you **struggle** to create a beautiful and universal user interfaces though your killer skills in programming.

## :rocket: Mission

My mission through this project is to simplify the UI design **FRONT-END** developers. Also, I want to collect the best practices about designing cutting-edge user interfaces.
